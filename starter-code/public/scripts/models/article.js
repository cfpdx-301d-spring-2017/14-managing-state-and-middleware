  // JOHN SAYS: loadAll is being called inside Article.fetchAll. This function is acting as an array-builder. It is checking the publication dates of each article and sorting them. Upon doing so, it loads them into the Article.all array. Loadall lives in Article.js along with the other functions referenced in this code block.

  // JOHN SAYS: numWordsByAuthor is called in adminView.js. The sole purpose of this function is to take in an item from the array, an author, and then filter the array into unique authors with no duplicates. It then counts the amount of words that each author has generated and tallies them per author and returns the word count and author name as an object literal. The parsing is done through regex. numWordsByAuthor uses the .filter, .map, and .reduce functions which exist as standard javascript array methods.

  // JOHN SAYS: The sole purpose of this AJAX call is to mirror what would normally be done in a SQL truncate command. Traditionally, a truncate command would empty a table of contents but would not drop the table. In this instance, this method, as it lives here, and as it executes here, calls the original path to articles with a deletion command. It orders the removal of a given article or all articles selected from the DOM. This function does take a callback and return a callback as a promise.
